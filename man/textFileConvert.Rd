\arguments{
\item{txt_file}{The name of the original “.txt” file from oxygen meter}

\item{type_file}{Indicates the type of software that was used to record raw data, options: "Firesting_pre2023", "Firesting_2023", "Witrox", "PreSense_microplate"}

\item{nrowSkip}{The number of rows to skip if the default does not work; the argument 'type_file' determines the default N rows to skip "Firesting_pre2023" = 19, "Firesting_2023" = 70, "Witrox" = 41; "PreSense_microplate" = 10, these rows in raw txt file often contain calibration information, the IDs of the probes and other user defined settings}

\item{N_Ch}{The number of oxygen meter channels. Options include 2, 4, 8, 24. (microplate). If a 2-channel oxygen meter was used, this argument could be ignored, or enter 4}

\item{local_path}{Logical. If TRUE (default) all returned files will be saved in the local working directory.}

\item{exclude_rows}{Rows to be excluded; used when there are unvanted NAs, or no sensor data. etc.}

\item{exclude_first_measurement_s}{DEPRECATED nov 2024: use 'exclude_measurement_s' (see documentation), The number measurement point to be excluded from the beginning of the file (in addition to the nrowSkip argument)}

\item{convert_units}{Logical (FALSE = default). If true, the function is passed to rMR function DO.unit.convert to convert O2 content units.}

\item{units_from}{default NULL, options:"mg/L", "PP", "pct". passed down to rM::DO.unit.convert arg. DO.units.in}

\item{units_to}{= default NULL, options:"mg/L", "PP", "pct". passed down to rM::DO.unit.convert arg. DO.units.out}

\item{channels}{= c(1,2,3,4), indicate which channels to apply the conversion to}

\item{salinity}{= 0, passed down to rMR::DO.unit.convert arg. salinity (must be in "pp.thou")}

\item{atm_pressure}{= 1, passed down to rMR::DO.unit.convert arg. bar.press (must be in "atm")}

\item{temperature}{user set consistent temperature for all channels (ºC)}

\item{device}{only for for "Firesting_2023" output files. Results from multiple devices can be recorded on one file. These are differentiated by uppper case letters "A", "B", etc. use this argument to specify which device is used, default is "A".}

\item{file_extension_id}{custom file extension for the saved csv file, default is "2"}

\item{temperature_Ch}{Numerical, select the channel to use for temperature recording. This is used only for 4-channel firesting, when probe/channel 1 was not plugged in and therefore has all values as "NA". default is channel 1.}

\description{
Uses to convert and format (strip from unused columns and rows) the raw '.txt' data file to produce a .csv file that is required for `MMR` and `SMR` functions.
